<r_> <h2>Who Are The Anons?</h2> </r_>
<p>
Much has been written about Q but little has been said about the vast anonymous army that stands behind the Q phenomenon,
driving the movement forward with impressive works of revelation showing the true extent of the Deep State machine which
the Q team is fighting against. Anyone familiar with the Q movement will know about the anonymous networks called
4chan and 8chan. Information here:
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan">Wikipedia page on 4chan</a> -- <a href="https://www.4chan.org">4chan site</a>
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8chan">Wikipedia page on 8chan</a> -- <a href="https://8ch.net">8chan site</a>
<p>
Q first began posting on October 28, 2017 on the board <i>/pol/</i> (Politically Incorrect) on 4chan. Q started posting on
8chan on November 25, also on <i>/pol/</i>, due to some security concern. What we will look at here is the first week when 
Q began posting in order to examine the reactions of the anonymous posters on 4chan to the revelations of Q. These reactions
range from disbelief to hopefulness that this person, who did not yet identify as Q, might actually be telling the truth
about the existence of a team of military operators working against the Deep State.
<p>
Before we start, I want to offer some hints toward understanding how to read these posts. 4chan and 8chan are very 
similar. Posters are normally anonymous and can only be identified by an ID code which persists on one conversation thread
only. This makes it impossible to match posters on one thread with those on another. The ID is derived from the poster's
IP address and is thus only persistent as long as the IP remains unchanged. This is an issue for users with a dynamic IP
since the ID is sometimes useful for tracking a conversation. Depending on the service provider, an IP address may
persist for only a few days or for as long as several weeks and it may even change abruptly while it is in use. For that
reason, do not be surprised when you see a contributor within a thread suddenly vanish. That person might still be
there under another ID.
<p>
Originally, Q remained anonymous so the only way to identify who was Q on successive threads was to examine the content
and writing style of the posts. Q's style is formal and he seldom references another poster or post directly. That makes it
pretty easy to identify Q since most people employ a very casual (and often caustic) style of speech and they frivolously
respond to other posters. Q began using what is called a tripcode on November 9. A tripcode is simply an unique ID secured
by a password. It is not used to log in or to identify oneself to the system. The purpose is to have an ID that is
persistent across threads. There are two levels of tripcode security and Q only used the weak version initially,
on purpose, as a honeypot to entrap hackers attempting to obstruct Q's mission.
<p>
Every post has a number which is unique to the entire board and is not tied to a particular thread. It is impossible to tell,
by its number, what thread a post appears in. This creates some issues which even plague 8chan today since it is possible
to reply to a post in another thread but without alerting the unwary viewer that going to that post requires loading up
the entirety of the other thread. Perhaps this will be addressed at some time in the future but, for now, one must be aware
of impulsive clicking since this can lead to a long wait as the other thread loads. So keep this in mind whenever you
visit 4chan or 8chan.
<p>
There are a number of sites which track all of Q's posts and <i>qmap.pub</i> is the one which will be referenced here and
in subsequent documents. The Q posts shown here all have a link to its entry on <i>qmap.pub</i> where more information is
available.
<p>
I think that is enough background for this topic. Now let's have a look at Q's first day on 4chan. At that point, there was
an individual on the board pretending to have insider knowledge of certain events. This is usually called "larping" which
is a term that derives from the phrase "Live Action Role Play". So this "larper", who may have been active on a previous
thread, left a post regarding the pending arrest of Hillary Clinton. The thread was on the topic of the Mueller
investigation and the larper responded to the original post. Q introduced himself by responding to the larper. This is
highly ironic and I think Q intended it to be so. The copied posts below employ two different background colors in order
to mark out Q and the larper. The posts are in chronological order so you need to check the post numbers to see
which post someone may be responding to.

HRC extradition already in motion effective yesterday with several countries in case of cross border run. Passport
approved to be flagged effective 10/30 @ 12:01am. Expect massive riots organized in defiance and others fleeing the US
to occur. US M's will conduct the operation while NG activated. Proof check: Locate a NG member and ask if activated
for duty 10/30 across most major cities.

<br>I have been busy, unable to reply. But yes, all of the files will come on, underacted. The only thing that will be withheld will be witnesses that are still alive or anyone they may be dead that could still cause fallout onto family members or friends of said people. There will be no protection or things withheld to protect anyone or anything, including the government bodies or officials.

<br>You are correct. Also anyone that may want evidence like you said, it is very simple for people to contact the National Guard like you stated. They are prepared for riots / happening on Monday and into the next week,

<br>What do you think we are doing? I'm telling you guys Hillary is getting arrested, and no one believes me just like the media do not. You will more than likely have to wait until Monday morning for your real proof unless a online media source picks up on it.
<br>I'm not directly connected to the case, or investigation. I do know people that are. I however, will not risk exposing anyone because I do not want them removed from case matters because I want to know what is going down. Hillary's arrest is only the beginning. I expect the election anniversary to be wild.

You can see what I mean about Q's style. His posts are devoid of grammatical or spelling errors, unlike the larper's posts.
This is important to establish Q's credibility. The Q posts continue on the next day in another thread. The larper, if
present, does not persist. One wonders if this person is an avid Q follower today. Who knows? Except the larper himself.
The posts are in chronological order. All replies are directed to Q.

And so Q's second day concludes. The thing to remember about the Anons on <i>/pol/</i>, whether it is 4chan or 8chan, is
that they are highly motivated individuals who scour the Internet and many other sources for information regarding their pet
subjects which are sometimes highly esoteric. They are extremely well informed on their favourite topic. As the Q movement
progresses, these people come to be labelled with endearing monikers such as "lawfag" or "planefag" because they 
are expert on a specific topic. One will often see a post asking for a "fag" to help out on a research project. This is 
how work gets done because no single person has access to all knowledge. You will notice in these posts that some people
may be unaware of certain things, even what some may regard as common knowledge, but don't take that as a clue to the 
actual knowledge level of the Anon. They are not "jacks of all trades".
<p>
So far, Q has not created a stir since he has said little which is not already known to the Anons. Q is being cautious here
as saying too much would arouse accusations of "larper" but he must also make certain that people understand that he does
indeed possess insider knowledge.
<p>
Q returns on the third day with 8 more posts. The format here is a Q post, followed by all
of its replies, then another Q post. The replies are in chronological order only with respect to the initiating Q post.
Any replies which reference multiple Q posts appear after the last post referenced.

<br>Why did Soros transfer his bulk public funds to a NP? Note this doesn't include massive slush funds that are pulled by several high ups.
<br>Why did Soros' son have several meetings with Canadian PM and how is that related to Clinton's?
<br>Why is MS13 a priority?

<p></p>Why wasn't HRC prosecuted for the emails? Put simply, Obama ultimately OK'd by using the non govt email addy to communicate w/ Clinton. Obama also had an alias along with each of his cabinet members. Therefore indicting HRC would lead to indicting Obama & his cabinet etc which could never happen. Remember he lied about knowing but that ultimately came out in the dump. Poof!

<br>POTUS installed his people within each top spot at each 3 letter agency except 1 (good reason there as Adm R kick started this and scrubbed all POTUS nominations to verify oath).
<br>Do you think they aren't in control of those respective agencies?

<br>D's can't lose control over the black population.
<br>At some point the great awakening will occur whereby these false local / national black leaders are corrupt and paid off to help keep the black pop poor and in need.
<br>D's formed the confederate states against freeing slaves.
<br>D's formed the KKK.
<br>HRC's mentor is who?
<br>What happens if the truth about Haiti is released? Do D's lose majority of the vote?
<br>Through the looking glass.
<br>They rely on the MSM to keep the narrative going but tech is entrenching on their controls. They missed this in 2016 and desperately attempting to censor now due to CIA cash infusions. This will fail.

<p></p> Remember, the FBI, and MI, have an open investigation into the CF. Why did Comey drop this? Who was the FBI director during the Haiti crisis? How many kids disappeared? How much money sent to CF under disguise of H relief went to H? What countries donated big money to CF and why? How much was owed by accepting? When she lost how would this be repaid? What did Obama do with cash just prior to leaving office? Repayment to those who donated for favors/access? Dig!!!!!
<br>Again, good people were forced into bed with this evil under personal and family threats. Could you live with yourself helping to cover up such evil despicable acts if given a safe way out? These people worship Satan _ some openly show it.

<br>Under what article can the President impose MI take over investigations for the 3 letter agencies? What conditions must present itself? Why is this so VERY important? Who surrounds POTUS? They lost this very important power _ the one area of the govt not corrupt and directly serves POTUS.

Q has revealed the fact that Military Intelligence is working against the Deep State as represented by the FBI, the CIA
and the NSA. It would later come out that MI got control of the NSA, leaving the FBI and the CIA. The partisan players
in the FBI will be fired or will resign over the coming months, leaving the CIA as the primary enemy.

This is the point at which the Anons start paying serious attention. This is first-class insider material.

And so concludes the third day. There is much commotion at the end of the thread as various Anons attempt to screenshot
Q's posts. I don't know what they intended to do with these since the thread contents can be saved from any web browser.
<p>
Due to the sheer volume of posts and replies, this document is broken up into multiple parts. As the journey progresses,
we will see the Anons' excitement rise as Q reveals more. The last post above is only slightly exaggerated. Though it may
be hard to understand to those who are not familiar with the nature of the Q movement and its players, the effect that
Q has had on people is legendary. Keep in mind, though, that the Anons are sufficiently intelligent and well-informed
to have outed Q as a larper long before Q hit the mainstream. This is, as they say, "for reals".
