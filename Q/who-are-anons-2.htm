<p></p>Some of us come here to drop crumbs, just crumbs.
<br>POTUS is 100% insulated - any discussion suggesting he's even a target is false.
<br>Follow Huma tomorrow.
<br>POTUS will not be addressing nation on any of these issues as people begin to be indicted and must remain neutral for pure optical reasons. To suggest this is the plan is false and should be common sense.
<br>Focus on Military Intelligence/ State Secrets and why might that be used vs any three letter agency
<br>What SC decision opened the door for a sitting President to activate - what must be showed?
<br>Why is POTUS surrounded by generals ^^
<br>Again, there are a lot more good people than bad so have faith. This was a hostile takeover from an evil corrupt network of players (not just Democrats).
<br>Don't fool yourself into thinking Obama, Soros, Roth's, Clinton's etc have more power present day than POTUS.
<br>Follow the money, it's the key.
<br>What is Pelosi's net worth by way of one example. Why coincidentally is her memory apparently going?
<br>Cover for possible future indictment to plead what?
<br>What if John M never had surgery and that was a cover for a future out if needed against prosecution?
<br>Why did Soros transfer his bulk public funds to a NP? Note this doesn't include massive slush funds that are pulled by several high ups.
<br>Why did Soros' son have several meetings with Canadian PM and how is that related to Clinton's?
<br>Why is MS13 a priority?
<br>Could people pay such gangs to kill opponents and why / how to insulate against exposure?
<br>The truth is mind blowing and cannot fully be exposed. These people are evil.
<br>Operation Mockingbird.

<p></p>Why wasn't HRC prosecuted for the emails? Put simply, Obama ultimately OK'd by using the non govt email addy to communicate w/ Clinton. Obama also had an alias along with each of his cabinet members. Therefore indicting HRC would lead to indicting Obama & his cabinet etc which could never happen. Remember he lied about knowing but that ultimately came out in the dump. Poof!

<br>Hillary was not prosecuted because the Uniparty Globalist Swamp Scum all work together.
<p></p>When the Democrats (Clintons et al) started giving blow jobs to and French kissing the Republicans (Bushes et al), EVERY freaking Plebe should have been crystal clear on what's going on here and whether that agenda was good for Plebes.

<p></p> Huma
<br>Husband in jail.
<br>HRC, Muslim Brotherhood, or child?
<br>What would you do? Kiss your child goodbye and leave without a mother or father for Clinton?
<br>Where is Huma today?
<br>Was she with HRC on her book tour?
<br>RE: Military Intelligence / State Secrets
<br>No FBI
<br>POTUS installed his people within each top spot at each 3 letter agency except 1 (good reason there as Adm R kick started this and scrubbed all POTUS nominations to verify oath).
<br>Do you think they aren't in control of those respective agencies?
<br>What is most valuable?
<br>Information
<br>AG Sessions on leakers.
<br>Fire or prosecute?
<br>Reorg is underway and happening.
<br>Coincidence Senate Republicans pushing for Fed Judge confirmations last week?
<br>Why are Senate Republicans dropping out? Not by choice and were offered a choice (rest assured they will vote pro Trump).

<p></p> Projection
<br>D's can't lose control over the black population.
<br>At some point the great awakening will occur whereby these false local / national black leaders are corrupt and paid off to help keep the black pop poor and in need.
<br>D's formed the confederate states against freeing slaves.
<br>D's formed the KKK.
<br>HRC's mentor is who?
<br>What happens if the truth about Haiti is released? Do D's lose majority of the vote?
<br>Through the looking glass.
<br>They rely on the MSM to keep the narrative going but tech is entrenching on their controls. They missed this in 2016 and desperately attempting to censor now due to CIA cash infusions. This will fail.

<p></p> Remember, the FBI, and MI, have an open investigation into the CF. Why did Comey drop this? Who was the FBI director during the Haiti crisis? How many kids disappeared? How much money sent to CF under disguise of H relief went to H? What countries donated big money to CF and why? How much was owed by accepting? When she lost how would this be repaid? What did Obama do with cash just prior to leaving office? Repayment to those who donated for favors/access? Dig!!!!!
<br>Again, good people were forced into bed with this evil under personal and family threats. Could you live with yourself helping to cover up such evil despicable acts if given a safe way out? These people worship Satan _ some openly show it.

<p></p> Key:
<br>Military Intelligence v FBI CIA NSA
<br>No approval or congressional oversight
<br>State Secrets upheld under SC
<br>Who is the Commander and Chief of the military?
<br>Under what article can the President impose MI take over investigations for the 3 letter agencies? What conditions must present itself? Why is this so VERY important? Who surrounds POTUS? They lost this very important power _ the one area of the govt not corrupt and directly serves POTUS.
