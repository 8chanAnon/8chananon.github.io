<br>I've had a feeling since before the election that the all seeing eye has finally had enough. We didn't get to this point by luck and for those of us protecting the spirit of our nation there's a winged guardian illuminating our path, ordained by god himself.
<p></p>I know that sounds all flowery and full of zeal, but I feel America running through my veins. Its the ghosts and the sentiments and a knowing that powerful people with America in their hearts are with us to the end.

<br>If I wait til I read through entire thread you will be gone & I don't want to miss saying Thank You. This info puts so
many puzzle pieces together. I especially believe the part about Sessions. He, Bannon & Trump single handedly red pilled
the electorate about the invasion of our borders. These 3 men were the ones I trusted completely. Will be so glad when 
Sessions gets his reputation back. I knew we had white hats keeping the election from being stolen although her numbers 
were inflated billy. God has given us a leader with extraordinary abilities and strength to help retake our Republic. 
I thank you & those like you Anon. Be safe

<p></p> There are more good people than bad. The wizards and warlocks (inside term) will not allow another Satanic Evil POS control our country. Realize Soros, Clintons, Obama, Putin, etc. are all controlled by 3 families (the 4th was removed post Trump's victory).
<p></p>11.3 - Podesta indicted
<br>11.6 - Huma indicted
<p></p>Manafort was placed into Trump's camp (as well as others). The corruption that will come out is so serious that deals must be cut for people to walk away otherwise 70% of elected politicians would be in jail (you are seeing it already begin). A deep cleaning is occurring and the prevention and defense of pure evil is occurring on a daily basis. They never thought they were going to lose control of the Presidency (not just D's) and thought they had control since making past mistakes (JFK, Reagan).
<p></p>Good speed, Patriots.
<br>PS, Soros is targeted.

<p></p> Get the popcorn, Friday & Saturday will deliver on the MAGA promise. POTUS knows he must clean house (gov't) 
in order to 'free up' and demonstrate who has authority in order to pass important legislation. This was always the 
priority. Remember, AG Sessions cannot look like an impartial player that is out to get all former Obama team members 
as we need him for other important work. All will come into focus and for anyone to think POTUS is not in control is 
kidding themselves. Also, he's 100% insulated with zero risk of impeachment (fact).

<p></p> Why does Obama travel in advance of POTUS to foreign locations?
<br>Why is this relevant?
<br>Focus on the power of POTUS as it relates to the Marines.
<br>How can MI be applied to prosecute bad actors and avoid corrupt agencies and judges?
<br>Biggest drop on Pol.
<br>Above is reason why the shills are sliding. In case you didn't know, shills log and send new info back to ASF for instruction. They use a 5 prong pre packaged injection (one post auto generates four more at random designated times). Common drive of posts they all tap into. Since they misjudged the influence of the MSM they are aggressively looking to censor throughout major platforms in exchange for CIA slush funds and WW access for expansion of said networks. Everything they do has been forecasted and prepared for.

<br>Like I said, you don't grasp the reality of the demographic problem. Whatever you're working on is doomed to fail. Putting Republican policies in Detroit or Zimbabwe won't make them much better. They're awful because they're full of very low intelligence highly impulsive people.

<br>Being too soft. This is why problems come back in a generation because hardly anyone ever finds out about what really happened. I have a pretty good guess about who you really are and here is my $3.50 worth.
<p></p>1. The mean American has a pretty set mind that Washington is corrupt and is basically screwing the little guy like him over
<br>2. Trump was seen by a ton of people, literally a ton of real, working people who have real life experience as a better choice because he appeared to be a genuine human being full of pros and also full of cons, compared to sleazeball political roaches that say x-y-z and fuck c-b-a.
<p></p>It would do the country far greater good in the long run if this grand scale Swamp Cleanup operation was more 
publicized and more politicians put on trial, PUBLICALLY and sent to jail and PUNISHED SEVERELY. You need to tap into the 
averages voter mindset about Washington Corruption and reaffirm it and then essentially turn millions of those beliefs 
into a 'mental wave' and ride that during the Cleanup and Rebuilding period of American Republic.
<p></p>With the severity of the crimes and the large list of the criminals I believe it would the Republic far greater good 
in the longterm if the flith was exposed, purged in the light and thus history was written to trully reflect what really 
transpired behind the shadows all these years and how the great American Experiment continued to triumph on victoriously, 
despite the setbacks and the gravitas of the situation it was in. Don't purge it into the dark chambers of Top Secret 
Document Archives. Record this, write this, spin this as part of New American Republic history.

<br>3. Keeping these happeneings on the down-low and under wraps is a mistake. Sparing former presidents from punishment 
and public scrutiny and "hellfire" is also a huge mistake. While it does spare the POTUS office from now being associated 
with pathetic criminal failures it also by logic allows people to assume that Presidents have never committed heinous 
crimes/acts and that Nixon was the worst thing that was ever done. The office of POTUS is not some Holy Papal Seat of the 
Vatican, the President is a human being just like the rest of us and therefore fallible. Not releasing info because it 
might hurt some feelings or somehow 'weaken' the trust in the Presidency and its image is stupid. Every 4-8 years, half 
of the voting (or the loud shouting) block "loses" their faith in the Presidency. If we find out that GW Bush SR was 
associated with JFK conspiracy, the outcome of that will not be a severe as your N number of analysts have concluded. At 
least with regards to local USA matters, I don't know what the impact will be w/ regards to international matters.
<p></p>4. HUGE BLUNDER by MISSING the PR OPPORTUNITY of a LIFETIME - God is basically giving you guys the perfect keys 
and combinations to restart this country to "Under God" and you guys are too scared and faithless to go ahead with it. 
You have the information, you have the evidence, basically everything on worst scum of society but you are too afraid to 
go ALL IN because of the possible negative consequences. Holy shit, we are talking about trying to bring down pedos, 
satanists! Well, guess what, if you don't do it now, USA is going to be back in the same spot in two generations and 
then it will be even worse. Use this chance, bring down all the dirt and the swamp creatures and show to the majority 
of Americans that the America we believe in (or used to believe in as for some) is still alive, there is still hope 
and that the governmen & wealthy are not all huge pieces of shit. Audentes Fortuna Adiuvat!

<br><g_> >What must be completed to engage MI over other (3) letter agencies</g_>
<br>During the 1950s and 60s, federal troops and federalized National
Guard forces, accompanied by military intelligence personnel, were
deployed to help integrate Southern schools23 and to help deal with
civil disorders in Detroit in 1967 and other cities the following year
after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.24 Throughout
this period military intelligence units also continued to collect data on
Americans at home who were suspected of involvement in subversive
activities.25 In the late 1960s, the Pentagon compiled personal
information on more than 100,000 politically active Americans in an
effort to quell civil rights and anti-Vietnam War demonstrations and
to discredit protestors.26 The Army used 1,500 plainclothes agents to
watch demonstrations, infiltrate organizations, and spread
disinformation. 2
<br>' According to one report, the Army had at least one
observer at every demonstration of more than twenty people.28
The Army's activities were summed up by Senator Sam Ervin:
Allegedly for the purpose of predicting and preventing
civil disturbances which might develop beyond the control of
state and local officials, Army agents were sent throughout
the country to keep surveillance over the way the civilian
population expressed their sentiments about government
policies. In churches, on campuses, in classrooms, in public
meetings, they took notes, tape-recorded, and photographed
people who dissented in thought, word, or deed. This included clergymen, editors, public officials, and anyone who
sympathized with the dissenters.

It would always piss people off on the image boards, and would always result in down votes on sites that do that. I have never believed it was China. I remember asking who runs NK on some forum, and someone posted a picture of Kim Jong with some of the usual shady characters, among them, if I recall right, John Podesta. I wish I had saved the picture. Thank you for all your breadcrumbs. I truly hope President Trump's actions result is diminished foreign influence in America.

<br>NK is propped up by Russia. Putin's second daughter is married to the Staff General who runs Kim's nuclear program. NK is a large consumer of Russian tech.
<p></p>China props up NK as a buffer state to contain refugees trying to jump out of the poor Tier II cities / Cantons in East China which has imploded since the metal / oil crash of 2014.
<p></p>PRC has a hammerlock on NK by owning their coal and consumer trade accounts.
<p></p>The Kim's themselves have bank accounts in Switzerland, France and Spain. This is all public knowledge which was leaked to the press. Like Saddam Hussein, there are multiple actors in South Korea who have facilitated the Kim's evasion of sanctions since 1980. These controlled exits, most of them via shell companies tied to the Kim's family office, like the Castro's are used to track money laundering conduits via Treasury Department & SWIFT intermediaries.

<p></p> World stalemate.
<br>We all have the goods on everyone else.
<br>That's part of the reason why some things that tie back to foreign heads of state will remain classified (not all).
<br>We are in one of the most critical times of our country. Trump and others are working to balance the we're doing well for America (for the common person to endorse) while at the same time purify our govt and remove the bad actors who are entrenched. There is so much string pulling and blackmail that we need to cut these off to truly gain the power granted to us by the Patriots and hard working people of this great country.

<p></p> Maybe one day but it cannot go slow. The initial wave will be fast and meaningful. It will send a signal to others immediately and you'll see the tide turn (not even the MSM can hide and rest assured some will be jailed as deep cover agents).

<br>aren't amberlamps red and blue, anyway? if the source lights are far enough away and the white house is adequately lit, you wouldn't see emergency lights on the building anyway. think of shadows; you get rid of a shadow by shining a light on it.
