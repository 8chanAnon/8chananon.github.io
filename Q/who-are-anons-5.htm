<p></p> Why is the information re: BO important re: U1 and export approval to Canada to EU?
<br>Where is BO today?
<br>Did BO and/or his admin ever make false statements that U1 would never be exported from the US?
<br>Who made those statements?
<br>Who did they report to?
<br>Why is this relevant?
<p></p>The public has been given a select taste (i.e. sampling) - rest assured others have it all (100% verifiable and impossible to refute).
<br>Why is this relevant?
<br>Who controls the narrative?
<br>Why are left wing organizations beginning to report on DNC/D corruption?
<br>Does the CIA have operators inside the MSM?
<br>What happens if exposed?
<br>What happens if tied back as 'knowing' to execs?
<br>What does this have to do with 'leaking'?
<br>What if it can be verified no sourced stories (made up) were in fact (and approved) to be published?

<p></p> What is Q Clearance?
<br>What hint does that explicitly refer to?
<br>DOE?
<br>Who would have the goods on U1?
<br>Does stating 'Q' refer that person works in DOE?
<br>No.
<br>Does it refer that someone dropping such information has the highest level of security within all departments?
<br>Why is this relevant?
<p></p>(May 2010) BO "Russia should be viewed as a friendly partner under Section 123 the Atomic Energy Act of 1954" after agreeing to a new nuclear weapons reduction deal and helping US w/ Iran.

<br>I recall an article from early in the Trump Admin regarding a controversy over a certain someone receiving Q 
clearance. I can't find the article for reference, but I think it described how the US nuclear program falls under 
the DOE not the DOD. That is the signif of Q clearance - access to the nuclear program secrets, such as the decisions 
on U1, as well as highest level access across all departments. In hindsight, the furor over this person having access 
to the nuclear program secrets was about U1, and an ability to potentially see shadow government activity, and not 
national security. Thus a person with Q clearance would have the goods on U1.
<br>The Canadian PM is important for keeping a lid on whatever they are doing with the uranium that has been exported 
to CA? Maybe also for asylum? HRC and WJC went to CA for a week earlier in the year.

<br><g_> >How did NK obtain Uranium?</g_>
<p></p>As I recall, during Bill Clinton's admin, the US gave NK nuclear materials. Clinton's people claimed it could only be 
used for power, not for weapons. Republicans said that was bullshit, radioactive is radioactive, so it could be 
converted/adapted. I think the purpose was supposed to be to buy them off so they'd stop threatening their neighbors 
or something, but there were hints that it was a good deal for the Clintons (as usual), but it soon faded into the 
scandal background.
<p></p>Dunno if that's what you mean; maybe that uranium was used long ago. Obviously there's a question where the U1 went, 
and if it's the reason they suddenly claim to be making leaps ahead.
<p></p><g_> >Alice & Wonderland</g_>

<p></p><g_> >Why did BO send billions (in cash and wire) to Iran?
<br> >Why the cash component?</g_>
<p></p>So they can pay the smuggling, rat-line people for the Uranium. BO got his Iran deal by giving them HEU in exchange for getting rid of their domestic production of HEU capacity. Giving the illusion of a deal success, but really giving them what they want.
<br>Was it in exchange Iran helps wipe out BC,HRC little ISIS problem in Syria?

<p></p> ive watched as society has been effectively addicted to msm, apps, social media, games, music, all propaganda 
and the moment you try to open anyone eyes. you. are. shunned.
<br>being dumbed down, weakened and groomed for passivity and stupidity through food and their addictions. like calf 
literally being fattened for a slaughter.
<p></p>and with all the race war propaganda and pizzagate possibility, i became suicidal because i cant stand that no 
one will open their eyes and are being manipulated hard.
<p></p>i hope with all of my heart that Trump is going to make good on his promise to maga and clean the swamp. ive been 
thinking about joining the navy for corpsman greenside, and i would love to serve under a Trump administration if he 
really does clean swamp, (will try to join regardless no openings for corpsman right now though). I hope that what 
OPanon says is true. i will be praying for OPanon and all who risk their lives, for safety and that the Lord will 
guide them. and praying that what he says is true. and will be praying for the spiritual edification of God for Trump 
and for his complete safety in all of this. The pieces are coming together for me. and if this is true, those working 
with him are absolute geniuses because i would have never imagined their would be any way possible to take the monster
