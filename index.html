<b>Emergency update</b> - Rumble has changed its video ID length to 7 characters (up from 6 characters). This breaks
any video dated later than April 27. There are two changes to be made to the Alleycat Player source code
(<g_>alleycat-player-v5b.htm</g_>). Open your copy of the file in a text editor (like Notepad),
make the changes, save the file and then restart Alleycat Player.
<p></p>
Find the following two lines:<br>
<r_>Line #2557:</r_> <code><g_>if (src == 14 && (url = getid (url, 6))) req_rumble (url, frame, fmt); else</g_></code><br>
<r_>Line #3397:</r_> <code><g_>if (url.length < 5 || url.length > 6) throw ("!!!");</g_></code>
<p></p>
Change the "6" in the first line to "-7". Change the "6" in the second line to "7". Like this:<br>
<r_>Line #2557:</r_> <code><g_>if (src == 14 && (url = getid (url, -7))) req_rumble (url, frame, fmt); else</g_></code><br>
<r_>Line #3397:</r_> <code><g_>if (url.length < 5 || url.length > 7) throw ("!!!");</g_></code>
<p></p>
Rumble is no doubt anticipating higher traffic volume in the coming months so I guess they decided that the video ID
length was too short to cover it (they should have planned for that). Truth Social is merging with Rumble while Youtube
is committing suicide (get woke, go broke).

<b><r_>Alleycat Player has been updated (finally)</r_></b> - This is just a maintenance update to fix broken links.
The new <g_>Kraker Local Proxy Server</g_> code is done and is working wonderfully. I just need to write a bunch of
documentation (groan). Note that <g_>Alleycat Player</g_> does NOT require a Kraker update but you should get it
when it is ready because I made a few performance improvements. The <g_>8kun Bread Launcher</g_> will also be
getting an update. For board owners and board volunteers, I have added moderator support. For the peons, you can
now monitor post deletions in real time. Existing functionality has not changed because it is all working perfectly.
However, I have noted some major problems with NoScript on Firefox which breaks the Launcher in strange ways (this
occassionally breaks Alleycat as well). For this reason, I am using
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/umatrix">uMatrix</a> instead.
Seems pretty solid and more useful than NoScript. I'll have more to say about it later.

<b><r_>The installation and user manuals have been updated.</r_></b> Finally! That stuff was getting a bit moldy. Hopefully,
the new manuals will cover everything a little better. The following files have been updated in the installation zip:
<g_>alleycat-player.htm</g_>, <g_>kraker.js</g_>, <g_>dash_player.js</g_>. If you have already installed Alleycat
Player and the Local Proxy Server, you don't need to reinstall. Just go to the links given above for the updates.
<p></p>
<b>Please update</b> your copy of the Kraker Proxy Server. While Alleycat Player and the
8kun Bread Launcher both work fine with the old version 2a, you should really consider upgrading to the latest version
to get the Socks5 tunnel proxy. It's a GREAT tool for customizing your DNS. Check it out. It might seem complicated
at first but it'll grow on you. Trust me (kek and meow).
<p></p>

This is something that I think may need to be clarified: you need to copy the Bread Launcher files to the same folder
where you installed Alleycat Player. Even if you don't care to use the player, you still need the other files in order
to run the proxy server and the Youtube viewer in the Launcher.
<p></p>
Open the Launcher with the following URL: <g_>http://localhost:8080/launch-8kun.htm</g_>
<p></p>
To be clear, you CAN run the Launcher without the proxy server if you install a CORS unblocker though you won't be
able to run the Youtube viewer. This is covered in the Launcher instructions.

<r_>IMPORTANT!</r_> I ran a test with Node.js version 16 and it does NOT work with Kraker version 3a. The problem
is with the timing of a certain callback which breaks all connections going through port 8080. This totally affects
both Alleycat Player and the 8kun Bread Launcher. The installation zip has been updated with the correct version.
<p></p>
This issue has existed since April which is when version 16.0.0 came out. Omigod! And all this time, nobody has
bothered to tell me. Please update your copy of Kraker to version 3b. Sorry for any trouble this may have caused.

<b><b_>A brief history of the</b_> <r_>Alleycat</r_> <g_>BBS</g_></b>
<p></p>
The name comes from an old project I started in 1981 called "Alleycat BBS". This is of nostalgic value to me.
<p></p>
The Alleycat BBS (Bulletin Board System) has disappeared into the fog of history. Nothing can be found about it
in any archive. It was small with just 200 to 300 users. The computer which hosted it was also small. It was an
Ohio Scientific Superboard with 8K of memory (later upgraded), a one-Mhz 6502 CPU and a 300-baud modem with a
home-made phone pickup device. The code was written with a home-brew OS and a very basic machine code assembler.
The service ran for three years and enjoyed a solid reputation. The name "Alleycat" was fondly regarded and, no
doubt, persists in the minds of its former users. It seems only fitting to bring the name back to life. 
<p></p>
The term "Bulletin Board System" has fallen out of favour over the years. While the boards of today are certainly
more sophisticated than the boards from the 1980's, there is little difference in terms of the intended function.
Posting messages and replying to messages is a tradition that goes back to the stone age of computers.

<b><b_>Kraker Local Proxy Server</b_></b> is a tiny server based on Node.js which is a popular open-source web server
development platform. The server is used by Alleycat Player to access websites which would normally be inaccessible
due to browser cross-origin restrictions. This is fully explained in the installation instructions.
<p></p>
A recent upgrade provides an additional feature. This is a Socks5 tunnel proxy which you can use with your
web browser to select your preferred DNS provider or to bypass the DNS altogether. You can also access the Tor Network
automatically for ".onion" links. This requires installing the Tor Browser or the stand-alone Tor client.

<b>NEW!</b> The Launcher now supports auto-updating and posting. This is a significant upgrade and there is more
to come. The time is NOW to get this super-fast and ultra-efficient replacement for the default 8kun client.
