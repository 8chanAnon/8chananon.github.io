<b>Update</b> - <r_>October 3, 2024</r_> -
The next entry in my web scraping series should be out tomorrow (Friday). I have interesting information about Cloudflare
which, as far as I know, has not been discussed elsewhere. Getting past that 403 error may not be as hard as you think.
<p></p>
<b>Update:</b> here's the article: <a href="tut/scraping2.html">Web Scraping with your Web Browser: Bot Challenges</a>
<p></p>
My first article was posted on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41711835">Hacker News</a> on Tuesday afternoon.
I expected maybe a few hundred views but my naivete was quickly revealed. In the first hour, I got about 70 views and I
figured that it might persist for a few hours and then die down. Much to my surprise, the view count started climbing like
crazy, reaching a peak of 600 views per hour. The view count surpassed 10,000 in 37 hours. It is now reaching 12,000 and
not showing any sign of stopping.
<p></p>
What is even more interesting is the level of engagement, meaning hits on my website (6%), hits on the installation
walkthrough (0.7%) and hits on the Kraker download page (0.15%). The ratio of one potential customer per thousand tire
kickers continues to hold true. Of course, the ratio will improve over time because, right now, I'm a total nobody.
<p></p>
Also, a few people complained about the article presentation. One person said the article was "hard to read because of the
bad formatting". I inquired and was informed that the article fills the width of the screen on a wide-screen monitor. Yes?
Am I supposed to decide how wide your reading space should be? I honestly don't know what to do about that. Another
complained about the "horrendous color scheme". I'm not inclined to ask why in this case because one person's favourite
colour is another person's nightmare. I don't like white and I'm glad that the walls in my house are painted beige. Brownish
tones are, I think, a nice compromise between white and black. I dunno. Still thinking about it.
<p></p>
My repository for Alleycat Player has collected a few stars. It's been on hiatus for 2 years and I will get back to it soon.
My problem has been the total lack of engagement in the past. Why bother if literally nobody cares? Part of the issue has
been, in my opinion, the need of a local proxy server so that the player can do its magic. Much resistance to that which is
what this flurry of article writing is about.

<b>Update</b> - <r_>September 22, 2024</r_> -
The view counter on this page keeps counting up but I'm seeing little evidence that anyone is installing the local proxy
server. There's a view counter on the Kraker download page and I put a hidden counter on the installation walkthrough. I can
pretty much count the views on the digits of my hands and feet. Why is that? Who is bothering to visit this page without
bothering with anything else?
<p></p>
I've been monitoring the hits on my remote proxy server with the Vercel control panel and I'm not seeing any hits from the
<g_>Free TV & Movies Playlist</g_> app. What's up with that? Nobody has time to watch TV or even a movie? Nobody is curious
about whether the app even works or not? This is totally free stuff and it works so why not mess around with it? To the
developers among you: you'll want to study my code to understand how it does all of this magic. It's Javascript and not
at all minimized or obfuscated.
<p></p>
You can also take advantage of a fully functional <g_>YouTube Player</g_> app if you care to install it on the local proxy
server. Just copy and paste a YouTube link to play or download videos up to 1080p resolution. I'm not planning to build
a full-blown replacement for the YouTube user interface but an enterprising individual might want to try that. I'm available
for consultation if you're brave enough to tackle such a project. For a demonstration of how this could work, see the
app that I made specifically for the
<a href="dl/j6-rumble.htm">January 6 videos on Rumble</a> (there are 1297 playlists).
<p></p>
Scroll a little further down for the links to all of this fun and free stuff. Also, if you do decide to install the local
proxy server then you'll want to also get the <g_>Kraker Mockery</g_> app. This is a critical tool to have if you are
interested in reverse-engineering websites for the purpose of scraping links or other information. I have it as a persistent
tab in my web browser because I never know when I'll come across a video site worth scraping.

The U.S. TV channels are back on the menu, boys! I had to drop them because the source started putting up a Cloudflare
bot challenge. That's possible to bypass with the local proxy but not the remote proxy. The source has dropped
Cloudflare or Cloudflare dropped them. I see from the IP address that they are in Ukraine. In Kyiv. Not exactly
in the middle of a war zone but close. I suppose they are pretty safe from the copyright warriors there.
<p></p>
You can download the <r_>Free TV & Movies Playlist</r_> app from <a href="dl/playlist.htm" download>here</a> and the
playlist from <a href="dl/playlist.txt" download>here</a>. You will also need the
<a href="dl/hls_player.js" download>HLS player</a> to play the videos. If you have Kraker installed then put the files in
your Kraker folder. If you run the app from there then it will use the local proxy instead of the remote proxy. For those
that don't have or don't want Kraker then click the link below to run it from this website.
<p></p>
<a href="dl/playlist.htm">Free TV & Movies Playlist</a> --
<a href="https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/tree/master/streams">go here</a> for playlists organized by country
<p></p>
The app has a zoom feature and a brightness control (to compensate for HDR which looks dark and over-saturated when you
don't have HDR support). You can select 360p, 480p or 720p. You can load a playlist or save a playlist. The app should be
able to load any playlist that you find on the Internet. The playlist is saved with just the channel name and the URL. That
is, it cleans up the list, removing the other garbage that makes the playlist very hard to manage in a text editor.
<p></p>
On startup, the app loads a default playlist. As protection from the psychotic copyright warriors, the playlist is encoded.
The radio stations in the default playlist are mostly HTTP. If you run the app from this site (which is HTTPS), your browser
will likely reject HTTP audio or video.
<p></p>
The <a href="dl/yt-player.htm">YouTube Player</a> is still working fine. I guess Google is done messing around (for now).

What can I do to get people to install the local proxy server? There's been a lot of turmoil lately because YouTube changed
its code to frustrate tools like <g_>youtube-dl</g_> and their tactics seem to have had the desired impact. It's hard to
tell because nobody's coming out and saying "Hey! We got this!". There's still much bellyaching about the 403 error and
some complicated solutions have been devised but I don't know what the success rate is. Anyway, I have not been having any
issues with YouTube since they last fiddled around with stuff on August 13.
<p></p>
So I've decided to combine the features of the <g_>Free TV & Movies Playlist</g_> with the <g_>YouTube Player</g_> to come
up with a new and improved app which not only plays YouTube videos at the higher resolutions but also provides an
interface for downloading via FFMPEG. None of this could possibly work without the local proxy server so it's kind of a
killer app. The trick with the video playback is running a DASH player module to merge the separate audio and video tracks.
For downloading, we need to get FFMPEG to download the files through the proxy server and merge them into a single file that
is directly playable in the web browser or an external video player.
<p></p>
Once you have the Kraker proxy server installed, download the following files to your Kraker folder:
<p></p>
<table>
<tr><td><a href="Kraker-Local-Proxy-Server/install/yt-download.htm" download>this file</a>
  </td><td><g_>yt-download.htm</g_></td><td>the YouTube Downloader app</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="Kraker-Local-Proxy-Server/install/_blank_dash_mpd.txt" download>this file</a>
  </td><td><g_>_blank_dash_mpd.txt</g_></td><td>template for DASH mpd file</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="Kraker-Local-Proxy-Server/install/_blank_live_mpd.txt" download>this file</a>
  </td><td><g_>_blank_live_mpd.txt</g_></td><td>same as above but for livestreams</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="Kraker-Local-Proxy-Server/install/dash_player.js" download>this file</a>
  </td><td><g_>dash_player.js</g_></td><td>the DASH player module</td></tr>
</table><p></p>
Run the app and give it a YouTube video ID or full URL to play. Press the "Download" button to get a list of the formats
available for download. Click on one of the options and the app will construct a command line that looks like this:
<p></p>
&nbsp;<g_>ffmpeg -i http://localhost:8080/!720p.mp4 -i http://localhost:8080/!audio.mp4 -c:a copy -c:v copy
  vid-720(sGdWkl9M_TY).mp4</g_>
<p></p>
All you have to do is open a console where you have FFMPEG installed and paste the command line. The operation will go as
fast as YouTube allows since the download speed can sometimes be throttled. I've noticed that YouTube occassionally gives
bad metadata which will prevent the video from playing or downloading. Just try again. For downloading, you must re-select
your option to refresh the video links in the proxy server.

<b>Update</b> - <r_>September 2, 2024</r_> -
This is a killer app if ever there was one. <g_>Kraker Mockery</g_> is now available. This is a tool for website analysis.
It uses the Kraker proxy server and a small secondary server along with a browser app to monitor the activity on a website
and optionally save the content. It is fast and responsive, unlike some other tools that I've seen (which will go unnamed).
This is a superior replacement for the browser's developer tools, especially since some websites block the devtools using
the "debugger" command and other more devious tricks. You don't have to keep the web page open in order to inspect it. Run
the page, gather the data, close the page and study the results (even the DOM can be preserved). This is excellent for sites
which would otherwise consume a lot of your CPU and memory for nothing.
<p></p>
The biggest advantage is that, unlike other tools, Mockery allows you to open tabs in the browser to see the results. No
squinting to try to grok what's there. You can also keep multiple tabs open for reference. Maximum visibility and
accessibility is key to getting work done.
<p></p>
This tool is what I use to hack pirate websites, some of which have some pretty evil Javascript obfuscation. What's the
trick for working through the obfuscation? Get this tool and find out. The manual has everything to get you going.

<r_>Kraker Local Proxy Server</r_> basic features:<e_>&#x1f63a;</e_>
<ul><li>
configurable DNS manager with support for DNS-over-HTTPS
</li><li>
ability to route specific domains over a Socks5 or HTTP proxy
</li><li>
use Tor, I2P and normal Internet with the same web browser
</li><li>
ability to pin the SSL certificate for sensitive domains
</li><li>
observe and modify HTTP requests and responses
</li></ul>
You might get the idea that the purpose of the proxy server is to support your web browser. That's true. It is also
for developers. The last feature listed above supports the analysis and reverse engineering of complex websites in order
to scrape data from them. I use a special tool that I call Kraker Mockery which works with the proxy server and the web
browser to help me figure out how to scrape a site to get video links. Alleycat Player can then use the proxy server to
bypass browser restrictions to find and play the videos.
<p></p>
Some additional features:
<ul><li>
access to the local file system
</li><li>
websocket for global messaging
</li><li>
cryptographic support for RSA and AES
</li><li>
ability to mimic websites to fool the browser
</li></ul>
That last item can be especially useful to bypass security measures meant to block bots (like the Cloudflare bot fight
mode). You can steal cookies. You can hijack code from a website and run it in your own app. The sky is the limit.
<p></p>
If you have used man-in-the-middle (MITM) proxies like Fiddler, Charles or HTTP Toolkit then I have to tell you that
Kraker is not the same. Kraker is meant to be always online and it only intercepts HTTP requests on demand. It is not a
tool that you only run as needed. You need it all of the time.
<p></p>
Kraker has a very small memory footprint. It is 15 to 25 megabytes, depending on usage patterns. It runs under Node.js
and, as far as I can tell, it is bulletproof (crossing fingers, kek).

<b><b_>The Internet is getting tougher and more user-unfriendly</b_></b><e_>&#x1f63e;</e_>
<p></p>
As we've seen with YouTube's crackdown on ad blockers (the reason for the existence of my YouTube demo player), website
operators are getting more desperate for revenue and they are also looking for ways to lock you in. The unfortunate thing
is that the "security features" written into our web browsers are being used against us. Maybe that was always the intent
though I'm sure that the developers who work hard to maintain the code bases we all depend on are innocent of this.
Historically, developers have always been liberty-minded and they would be offended by the idea that they are the
unwitting pawns of "The Man" whom they have always fought against. Yeah, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt but,
at the same time, I'm sure that many of them behave exactly like tyrants when the shoe is on their foot. For example, the
push for every site to be HTTPS has these same "liberty-minded" developers acting like gate-keepers who look down on
anyone who prefers to just use HTTP. What kind of neanderthal uses HTTP? Are you not concerned for the safety of your
users? Ah, the old "safety" excuse. It's for the kids, right? The truth is that HTTPS is unnecessary for most websites and
it is another tool in the toolbox of those who would limit free speech.
<p></p>
The primitive state of copyright laws in an age of unlimited access to information is another sore point. The gate-keepers
would love for you to pay for every word you read but it is difficult to contain information which wants to be free.
Nevertheless, they keep trying and they will do anything to make you dependent on them. Paywalls are just one small part of
that. Now, I don't begrudge people for wanting to get paid for their work. I respect paywalls and I would never consider
hacking into a server to steal someone's property. However, I do begrudge attempts to leverage my own machinery against me.
<p></p>
I use a web browser to gain access to information and I despise those who would use its built-in software features as a
bludgeon to keep me away from information that wants to be free. Put up a paywall if you like. However, if your business
model requires you to shove ads in my face or to steal processing cycles from my CPU, then you are an enemy. It is difficult
for most people to comprehend the many ways that web browsers actually work against them because somebody running a website
wants to make sure that they stay inside the curated garden and not wander afield. A very simple example is copying an image
or some text which can be blocked by the browser in response to a server setting or some CSS or whatever. I'm sure you've
seen this sort of trick from time to time. Using the developer toolbox can sometimes work but there are nastier tricks
that can prevent even that.
<p></p>
My position is this: if I can see it or hear it in my web browser then I should be able to copy it or download it. I allow
some slack for the likes of Netflix because they're not pretending to offer "free access" to anything. They demand my money
up front and I respect that. YouTube does not get the same respect. If it plays in my browser without money changing hands
then I'm the one in control, not YouTube. They can scream about "copyright theft" all they like. If they don't want me to
share then they shouldn't be allowed to share either. Keep your crap in a vault somewhere but don't expect me to be
nice when you offer "free access" and then bitch about me taking that literally.
<p></p>
Some readers might note a smidgeon of hypocrisy when I say that I respect paywalls but, at the same time, I help
myself to movies and TV shows from websites which are clearly guilty of copyright theft since the material is not
normally available without paying. I won't argue the point. I'm a hypocrite but I like free stuff. The irony is that some
of these pirate websites are even more stingy with their "free access" than YouTube. It's a battle and a half sometimes to
liberate material which was stolen in the first place. There's plenty of room for hypocrites on the copyright bandwagon.
<p></p>
My mission is simple. It is to liberate that which is supposedly "free" but is being kept not free by virtue of the
features that are present in the web browser. If I want to watch a video on my own equipment under my own terms and
conditions then I ought to be able to do that. If it means "breaking" the web browser to liberate the material then I will
create the tools to do that. I'm not in any position to modify and compile the browser code. That would be too large of a
task. I have to somehow work both outside of and within the browser. This is the point of building a proxy server which I
can run on my own system and which will conform to my own needs. The proxy server acts as an intermediary between the
website which wants to block my access and the browser which needs to be told to shut up and let me go about my business.
<p></p>
Then all I have to do is write some HTML and some Javascript to tell the browser to go get what I want from where
I want without any bullshit. That's it in a nutshell. I invite you to follow me on my journey. Liberate your browser from
the tyranny of the Internet.

<b><b_>A brief history of the</b_> <r_>Alleycat</r_> <g_>BBS</g_></b><e_>&#x1f408;</e_>
<p></p>
The name comes from an old project I started in 1981 called "Alleycat BBS". This is of nostalgic value to me.
<p></p>
The Alleycat BBS (Bulletin Board System) has disappeared into the fog of history. Nothing can be found about it
in any archive. It was small with just 200 to 300 users. The computer which hosted it was also small. It was an
Ohio Scientific Superboard with 8K of memory (later upgraded), a one-Mhz 6502 CPU and a 300-baud modem with a
home-made phone pickup device. The code was written with a home-brew OS and a very basic machine code assembler.
The service ran for three years and enjoyed a solid reputation. The name "Alleycat" was fondly regarded and, no
doubt, persists in the minds of its former users. It seems only fitting to bring the name back to life. 
<p></p>
The term "Bulletin Board System" has fallen out of favour over the years. While the boards of today are certainly
more sophisticated than the boards from the 1980's, there is little difference in terms of the intended function.
Posting messages and replying to messages is a tradition that goes back to the stone age of computers.
