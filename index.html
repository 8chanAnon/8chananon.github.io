<b>Update</b> - <r_>August 13, 2024</r_> - Sigh. I've been battling YouTube because of IP address blocking and rate
limiting. My own proxy server is blocked permanently because it resides in an Amazon cloud. The substitute proxy
works but it gets rate limited. When that happens, the YouTube Player just won't work until the rate limit is lifted. The
new plan involves upgrading my proxy server so it can work through a socks5 proxy to hide the Amazon IP address. The upgrade
is done and working wonderfully. I have managed to find a handful of socks5 proxies that I can use. Most of them are pretty
unreliable but a couple are turning out to be dependable and fast. When the app opens, it picks the first proxy on the list
which is the best one. If that stops responding or if it gets rate limited then the app will rotate to the next proxy
on the list. Working good so far.
<p></p>
The problem with finding suitable proxies is that the majority are already blacklisted by YouTube. I might find 10 working
proxies but only one will be usable. It's a tedious process though I have this really nifty proxy checking tool which
will be one of the apps that you will get totally for free when I finally release my Kraker package. I don't know if any
of you are anticipating the release but I'm getting spurts of traffic here. Sometimes there's no traffic for a couple of
days and then there's a few dozen visitors. I don't know from where but it's nice to see.
<p></p>
In related news, I had to remove some of the U.S. TV channels from the Free TV & Movies playlist. The source is no longer
working. There are three other sources available but they require the local proxy server to work. There is only so much that
can be accomplished with a remote proxy.
<p></p>
On that note, some people might be wondering why I don't just write this stuff as a desktop app, free of the browser
restrictions. Well, that sounds nice but it's just trading one problem for another. I'm already offering you a desktop app
in the form of a proxy server so how does it make a difference to package everything as a desktop app? Besides that, my
apps need support for graphics, networking and video playback. Where should that support come from? The support is already
there in the web browser. I don't have to go searching for libraries to do what needs to be done. Despite the issues (and
there are many), I think the browser is an excellent development environment. Besides that, cracking these websites often
involves running Javascript which is easily done inside the browser but difficult and extremely error-prone otherwise. There
are a few pirate sites that could only be cracked by running a modified version of the Javascript inside an <i>iframe</i>
and extracting the video information by trapping an exit point. This would be impossible to do outside of the browser.
So, yeah, there is logic in my insanity.
<p></p>
Anyway, thanks for visiting. There is more to come.

<b>Update</b> - <r_>August 9, 2024</r_> - So I've been working on a new installation tutorial for the <g_>Kraker Local
Proxy Server</g_> and I've realized the need for some hands-on examples of powerful apps. Previously, I've just been
telling people to play around with Alleycat Player to see what the proxy server is good for but that is really insufficient.
For one thing, Alleycat Player does not exercise the advanced capabilities of the proxy and, even if it did, you wouldn't
even know without me telling you. Some small but useful apps as a demonstration of what the proxy can do would go a long
way. I already made one which is useful for browsing files on the local disk but I've kind of been at a loss for what to do
for a larger demonstration. Then it struck me that I should make an M3U playlist reader. I've been needing that because it
has been a pain in the ass to find working Internet TV channels by browsing through the barely readable text of an M3U file
in Notepad and copying the URL into Alleycat Player to test it. Well, now I have such an app and it makes the previous apps
that I made for TV and movies obsolete. I am offering you over 200 links for Internet TV, movies and some radio stations as
well. You can also make your own playlist or just use whatever you can find on the Internet.
<p></p>
All of these apps make use of a scaled-down remote version of my local proxy server. It is hosted by Vercel which, in turn,
is hosted by Amazon. It is a simple matter to block the proxy by the IP address and a number of websites are doing this
right now. I had a hard time finding a pirate movie source because the ones that I'd already hacked are blocking my proxy.
Either that or the hack is too involved anyway to be workable with a remote proxy. This blocking is actually news to me and
it must have started over the course of the past few months. Whenever I hack a site, I always check to see
whether or not it is workable with a remote proxy.
<p></p>
On August 6, YouTube started blocking my proxy and the YouTube Player app stopped working. I got it working again by a
stroke of pure luck. This story is a bit long so buckle up. It is very informative and it goes along with what I said in
my rant further down this page: "The Internet is getting tougher and more user-unfriendly". Everybody wants to lock you in
and part of the process is blocking what is called "headless apps". This means bots and scrapers which normally operate
without human intervention. My own utilities are, of course, not headless but they appear as such to websites. Jealous
website operators do not want you using unauthorized apps to access their sites. One way to block these evil apps is to
block the IP addresses belonging to data centres like Amazon Web Services. This is easily done with a list of all the data
centre IPs, as well as the IPs of all known proxy servers. Google has such a list since they've been blocking data centre
IPs from using Google search for at least the past couple of years and now they're doing the same for YouTube. Cloudflare
also has the list and many pirate websites are hosted there. I think there has been a pricing or policy change at Cloudflare
and that's why these pirate sites are now blocking my remote proxy whereas they did not have that ability prior to, say,
six months ago. So the problem that I had was finding another proxy server which is not blocked by YouTube.
<p></p>
A few years ago, finding proxy servers was not difficult. Alleycat Player offered five proxy servers before I built my own
at Vercel. They have all disappeared except for "api.allorigins.win" which has somehow resisted whatever abuses took down
the others. Unfortunately, that one was also blocked by YouTube so I was left with no options. The YouTube Player could not
be fixed. Just prior to offering the app for free movies, I discovered that the source (thetvapp.to) that I was using for
U.S. channels in the TV app is no longer accessible. It is blocked by a Cloudflare bot challenge. The challenge can
be bypassed using the local proxy server but that is not possible with the remote version.
<p></p>
This is an <a href="https://fmhy.net/videopiracyguide">excellent resource</a> for finding pirate sites. There is this one
interesting site (www.braflix.ru) which turned out to be somewhat more than just interesting. For one, it is a proxy for
the previously mentioned site which is now blocked by Cloudflare. Secondly, not only is my remote proxy server not blocked
but the video link itself goes through a proxy. I don't know why because the proxy is not needed. My app tosses away the
proxy wrapper. What is important is that this proxy is not blocked by YouTube. Thus, the YouTube Player has been fixed
though only partially. Age-gated videos no longer work because the new proxy does not accept the POST method. There were
issues already with some videos not working because of the IP address mismatch between the proxy server and the user.
Anyway, after all this I now find that "api.allorigins.win" is no longer blocked. I don't know why. It turns out that
it is hosted by Cloudflare but so is the other one that I used to fix the YouTube Player. What's going on?
<p></p>
I'll end this long story with a note. The nature of the block is not that the YouTube server refuses to deliver the file.
Rather, it delivers the file without the links to the video. This triggers the app to assume that the video is age-gated
and so it goes through a different route which also turns out to be blocked in a similar fashion. So the remote proxy server
works in one instance but not in the other. All of this works just fine with the local proxy server. I could be wrong but
I'm assuming for now that the difference is the IP address and nothing more.
<p></p>
The new app retains the functionality that I introduced with the Free Movies app. The zoom feature is the
same and I've included an additional level to the brightness control. The custom video control is unchanged. You can select
360p, 480p or 720p. You can load a playlist or save a playlist. The app should be able to load any playlist that you find
on the Internet. The playlist is saved with just the channel name and the URL. That is, it cleans up the list, removing the
other garbage that makes the playlist very hard to manage in a text editor.
<p></p>
On startup, the app loads a default playlist from the GitHub server. As protection from the psychotic copyright warriors,
the playlist is encoded on the server. I already got hit once with a DMCA notice on Alleycat Player and I don't want to
risk that again because the way it went down is that I had to delete and restore the entire repository. Of course, I have
my own local copies of everything and backups on a file storage service.
<p></p>
The radio stations in the default playlist are mostly HTTP. Since the app is loaded from HTTPS, your browser will likely not
allow HTTP audio or video because web browsers are becoming increasingly and more stupidly strict (for your safety, of
course, and not because design by committee leads to total bullshit). You can, however, open the audio link in a new tab.
This issue does not exist with the local proxy server.

In unrelated news, my neighborhood is starting to look like a jungle again. All of the gardens are overgrowing the
walkways. Trees are growing where there were no trees. It's crazy. The threat of carbon dioxide is not global warming but
the prospect of being buried alive by excess vegetation.

<b>Update</b> - <r_>July 31, 2024</r_> - I'm here to drop another gift, this time offering some new movies to watch. It's
similar to the Free TV app that I posted last time but for movies. I invested quite a bit of effort on finding a source that
doesn't need the local proxy server because most of them go out of their way to prevent somebody like me from bypassing their
shitty websites infested with popups, adware and malware. Some of them block certain IP addresses that belong to data
centres which are often used for web scraping. Or they may hide behind a bot wall, courtesy of Cloudflare. Anyway,
I've got a list of 16 recently released movies to entertain you for a while.
<p></p>
There is a particular issue with watching movies on a PC with a web browser. This issue is High Dynamic Range (HDR) versus
Standard Dynamic Range (SDR). HDR has to be supported by your monitor and video card and maybe the browser in order to work.
I don't understand the details but it's a big mess. What little research that I've done on the issue indicates that there
are a LOT of problems even when you have the hardware and software support for HDR. There are conflicting standards and the
support could be of such low quality that it hardly improves the viewing experience. For me, I have an old system with a CRT
so I'm far from venturing into HDR. I'm kind of clueless.
<p></p>
What I do know is that you can tell when a video is intended to be viewed as HDR when it comes up very dark and
over-saturated. I don't know if the pirate sites are actually dishing out properly encoded HDR or just SDR transcoded
from HDR. I'm not familiar with the process of how they rip the content from the official DVDs or streaming sites.
In any case, watching movies on a non-HDR system can be an exercise in misery but it doesn't have to be. While it is not an
ideal solution, it is possible to brighten and desaturate the video to make it watchable. That is, the video can be balanced
using the brightness, contrast and saturation settings in CSS. Unfortunately, gamma is not one of the options and it would
be a lot better with gamma but we can get most of the way to something tolerable. A full solution would require tinkering
with the video at the pixel level.
<p></p>
I have provided a single option in the app to brighten the video and it is a solution that will work satisfactorily most
of the time. Dark areas may still be too dark and bright areas will definitely be too bright but this is the best that can
be done. At least you'll be able to see what's going on and you won't be worrying about it much if the movie is any good.
<p></p>
Another issue is the super-wide format which is only suitable for theatres. It is horrible on a 4:3 monitor and annoying
on a 16:9 monitor. I've added an option to zoom the video to fit the vertical space. Obviously, this will crop the video
horizontally but you will barely notice. These two options, zoom and brighten, are not available anywhere else so I command
you to enjoy this limited-time offer.

I guess I'll be dropping little gifts here from time to time. Here's a cute little app for watching TV. It's a subset of
what will be available in Alleycat Player. There are 48 channels to play with. They are all in the United States in case
that matters. There are three categories: Alternative, Mainstream and Specialty. Many of the channels use my remote
proxy server to steal the video link from the originating site. Click the link below.

<b>Update</b> - <r_>July 21, 2024</r_> - I forgot to date my previous update which was submitted a week ago. This note is
just to let "whom it may concern" that I haven't suddenly gone away again. I also notice that the daily counter at the
bottom of this page shows 44 hits on this day. Huh, where is that coming from? I normally just get 1 or 2 hits a day though
I have no idea from where or why.
<p></p>
I'm sure you've been following the constant news about the staged assassination attempt. Yeah, I think it was staged but
we'll never really know the truth, just as we still don't know the truth about JFK or 9/11. The real truth would likely
shock us all so we'll never be told.
<p></p>
The broken link to my repository on Internet Archive has been fixed. See the note that I left near the bottom of this page.
Internet Archive sucks. I originally starting uploading to IA because I needed the ability to run HTML pages for my
Youtube Player project which was later renamed to Alleycat Player. Then IA blocked active HTML so the site lost most of its
usefulness. Right now, I'm feeling like I just want to delete everything.
<p></p>
I'll be doing a writeup on something that I've noticed about porn sites. This isn't about porn. It's just that I've noticed
that porn sites have not gone woke. You would expect them to be pushing gay pride and drag queens but you won't ever see
any of that. No pride flags and no drag queens even though you might think that drag queens would be a perfect fit for porn.
Why is it that the whole fucking western world is into faggot worship but porn sites are being all conservative? Isn't that
the one place where you would expect wokeness to be dialed up to eleven???

<b><r_>Stay tuned!</r_> <g_>The best is yet to come!</g_></b>
<p></p>
In the next few weeks, this place will come back to life after being put on hold more than a year ago. Why have I been away?
The answer is complicated but I won't bore you with a long story. Suffice to say that my software projects failed to attract
sufficient interest, to the point that I was working in the dark with no feedback whatsoever nor even any idea if anybody
has been using my software beyond an initial trial. I decided to just stop releasing code and to just take my time to make
everything better. This has been difficult because, as I said, there has been no feedback so I've been left to guess on my
own what features people may want or what features weren't working as intended.
<p></p>
Alleycat Player is not dead. I've been keeping it up to date insofar as it serves my needs. I still use it to play all of
my videos. I never play videos on YouTube or Bitchute or Rumble or any other site. I don't like the site designs and I
despise the ads (I'll never understand why a simple banner in the sidebar is not good enough). I watch my movies and TV
shows by stealing the video links from the pirate sites. My needs are being met. It's too bad that nobody else has been
benefiting. Really, all anybody had to do was drop me a message asking for an update and I would have obliged. I'm sad
that nobody bothered.
<p></p>
The Kraker Local Proxy Server is the reason why Alleycat Player has been able to do what no other browser app has ever done.
However, it seems that a lot of people have regarded the proxy server with suspicion, like it was going to mess around with
their OS or do nasty things in secret. I guess I can't blame them. We do need to be careful about what we install on our
machines. In any case, my aim has been to beef up the proxy server to make it an indispensible tool and not just a sidekick
to my video player.
<p></p>
Those who have survived through the many DNS outages on 8kun will remember the advice about updating the "hosts" file. Who
supplied the IP address for that? I did. How did I know? The Kraker proxy helped with that. I'm just trying to say that the
tool was always intended as a bit more than a crutch for Alleycat Player. The problem has been the lack of any apps to
demonstrate the features. As long as I'm tooting my own horn, some anons might (fondly) remember the 8kun Authentigator and
the spy-versus-spy scenarios (it was fun and no hard feelings, Jim).
<p></p>
My biggest problem right now is finishing the documentation. After over a year of work, there is a LOT to document.
Documentation is important but it's more important that it be written clearly and concisely so that people don't need to be
software engineers to grasp the concepts. That's hard but I can say that the hardest parts have been completed. It should
go a lot more smoothly from here on. I just need to kick myself to get it done. That's why I'm committing myself with
this post. Please yell at me if I take too long.

<r_>To whet your appetite</r_> - here's the link to my <a href="dl/yt-player.htm">YouTube Player</a> demo.
<p></p>
A couple of things: all videos are 360p and some videos won't play. The reasons are simple. First of all, YouTube has
dropped support for the 720p audio+video format, leaving 360p as the only option. 480p and higher formats are DASH only,
meaning that the audio and video tracks are separate rather than combined in a single file. This makes the video unplayable
in the web browser without additional software support.
<p></p>
Some videos have a setting which prevents the video from streaming to a different IP address than the one used to load the
metadata. Put simply, <g_>www.youtube.com</g_> is where the metadata comes from (blocked by CORS) while the video itself
streams from a subdomain of <g_>googlevideo.com</g_> (not blocked by CORS). The demo player uses a remote proxy (a barebones
version of Kraker) to access YouTube but the proxy does not support video streaming due to bandwidth limits on the free
Vercel account. Therefore, YouTube sees an IP address belonging to an Amazon cloud server but Google sees your real IP
address so it blocks playback with a 403 error. This is a common issue with using a remote proxy server.

<b><b_>The Internet is getting tougher and more user-unfriendly</b_></b><e_>&#x1f63e;</e_>
<p></p>
As we've seen with YouTube's crackdown on ad blockers (the reason for the existence of my YouTube demo player), website
operators are getting more desperate for revenue and they are also looking for ways to lock you in. The unfortunate thing
is that the "security features" written into our web browsers are being used against us. Maybe that was always the intent
though I'm sure that the developers who work hard to maintain the code bases we all depend on are innocent of this.
Historically, developers have always been liberty-minded and they would be offended by the idea that they are the
unwitting pawns of "The Man" whom they have always fought against. Yeah, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt but,
at the same time, I'm sure that many of them behave exactly like tyrants when the shoe is on their foot. For example, the
push for every site to be HTTPS has these same "liberty-minded" developers acting like gate-keepers who look down on
anyone who prefers to just use HTTP. What kind of neanderthal uses HTTP? Are you not concerned for the safety of your
users? Ah, the old "safety" excuse. It's for the kids, right? The truth is that HTTPS is unnecessary for most websites and
it is another tool in the toolbox of those who would limit free speech.
<p></p>
The primitive state of copyright laws in an age of unlimited access to information is another sore point. The gate-keepers
would love for you to pay for every word you read but it is difficult to contain information which wants to be free.
Nevertheless, they keep trying and they will do anything to make you dependent on them. Paywalls are just one small part of
that. Now, I don't begrudge people for wanting to get paid for their work. I respect paywalls and I would never consider
hacking into a server to steal someone's property. However, I do begrudge attempts to leverage my own machinery against me.
<p></p>
I use a web browser to gain access to information and I despise those who would use its built-in software features as a
bludgeon to keep me away from information that wants to be free. Put up a paywall if you like. However, if your business
model requires you to shove ads in my face or to steal processing cycles from my CPU, then you are an enemy. It is difficult
for most people to comprehend the many ways that web browsers actually work against them because somebody running a website
wants to make sure that they stay inside the curated garden and not wander afield. A very simple example is copying an image
or some text which can be blocked by the browser in response to a server setting or some CSS or whatever. I'm sure you've
seen this sort of trick from time to time. Using the developer toolbox can sometimes work but there are nastier tricks
that can prevent even that.
<p></p>
My position is this: if I can see it or hear it in my web browser then I should be able to copy it or download it. I allow
some slack for the likes of Netflix because they're not pretending to offer "free access" to anything. They demand my money
up front and I respect that. YouTube does not get the same respect. If it plays in my browser without money changing hands
then I'm the one in control, not YouTube. They can scream about "copyright theft" all they like. If they don't want me to
share then they shouldn't be allowed to share either. Keep your crap in a vault somewhere but don't expect me to be
nice when you offer "free access" and then bitch about me taking that literally.
<p></p>
Some readers might note a smidgeon of hypocrisy when I say that I respect paywalls but, at the same time, I help
myself to movies and TV shows from websites which are clearly guilty of copyright theft since the material is not
normally available without paying. I won't argue the point. I'm a hypocrite but I like free stuff. The irony is that some
of these pirate websites are even more stingy with their "free access" than YouTube. It's a battle and a half sometimes to
liberate material which was stolen in the first place. There's plenty of room for hypocrites on the copyright bandwagon.
<p></p>
My mission is simple. It is to liberate that which is supposedly "free" but is being kept not free by virtue of the
features that are present in the web browser. If I want to watch a video on my own equipment under my own terms and
conditions then I ought to be able to do that. If it means "breaking" the web browser to liberate the material then I will
create the tools to do that. I'm not in any position to modify and compile the browser code. That would be too large of a
task. I have to somehow work both outside of and within the browser. This is the point of building a proxy server which I
can run on my own system and which will conform to my own needs. The proxy server acts as an intermediary between the
website which wants to block my access and the browser which needs to be told to shut up and let me go about my business.
<p></p>
Then all I have to do is write some HTML and some Javascript to tell the browser to go get what I want from where
I want without any bullshit. That's it in a nutshell. I invite you to follow me on my journey. Liberate your browser from
the tyranny of the Internet.

You might get the idea that the purpose of the proxy server is to support your web browser. That's true. It is also
for developers. The last feature listed above supports the analysis and reverse engineering of complex websites in order
to scrape data from them. I use a special tool that I call Kraker Mockery which works with the proxy server and the web
browser to help me figure out how to scrape a site to get video links. Alleycat Player can then use the proxy server to
bypass browser restrictions to find and play the videos.
<p></p>
Some additional features:
<ul><li>
access to the local file system
</li><li>
websocket for global messaging
</li><li>
cryptographic support for RSA and AES
</li><li>
ability to mimic websites to fool the browser
</li></ul>
That last item can be especially useful to bypass security measures meant to block bots (like the Cloudflare bot fight
mode). You can steal cookies. You can hijack code from a website and run it in your own app. The sky is the limit.
<p></p>
If you have used man-in-the-middle (MITM) proxies like Fiddler, Charles or HTTP Toolkit then I have to tell you that
Kraker is not the same. Kraker is meant to be always online and it only intercepts HTTP requests on demand. It is not a
tool that you only run as needed. You need it all of the time.
<p></p>
Kraker has a very small memory footprint. It is 15 to 25 megabytes, depending on usage patterns. It runs under Node.js
and, as far as I can tell, it is bulletproof (crossing fingers, kek).

<b><b_>A brief history of the</b_> <r_>Alleycat</r_> <g_>BBS</g_></b><e_>&#x1f408;</e_>
<p></p>
The name comes from an old project I started in 1981 called "Alleycat BBS". This is of nostalgic value to me.
<p></p>
The Alleycat BBS (Bulletin Board System) has disappeared into the fog of history. Nothing can be found about it
in any archive. It was small with just 200 to 300 users. The computer which hosted it was also small. It was an
Ohio Scientific Superboard with 8K of memory (later upgraded), a one-Mhz 6502 CPU and a 300-baud modem with a
home-made phone pickup device. The code was written with a home-brew OS and a very basic machine code assembler.
The service ran for three years and enjoyed a solid reputation. The name "Alleycat" was fondly regarded and, no
doubt, persists in the minds of its former users. It seems only fitting to bring the name back to life. 
<p></p>
The term "Bulletin Board System" has fallen out of favour over the years. While the boards of today are certainly
more sophisticated than the boards from the 1980's, there is little difference in terms of the intended function.
Posting messages and replying to messages is a tradition that goes back to the stone age of computers.

Due to some sort of mishap at Internet Archive, my username has changed from 8chanAnon to 8chanAnon2. My account was
deleted and I had to recreate it. I asked whether my original username could be restored and I got a terse negative
response. Awesome customer service. Not a finger lifted to resolve their own screw-up. Also, some time ago, my Europa
item got hit with a login requirement when the view count reached 5000. Not a good look.
