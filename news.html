Oh man! So long since I've typed something here. I just finished a massive update on the Kraker Local Proxy Server
instruction manual. There is a LOT to document with the new update to version 4a (and I still have a few more things
to cover but this is enough for now). Kraker isn't just a side tool for Alleycat Player anymore. It's now in the big leagues
and deserving of some kind of an award. If I do say so myself, kek.
<p>
Anyway, I'm tired right now but I'll be back soon to post my thoughts. Stay tuned, fren.

Alleycat Player will be two years old on December 7. Hard to believe that it's been that long. As noted on the main
page, the installation and user manuals have been updated. This was way overdue and I've had to really drag
myself to the task after leaving it aside for over a year. Now it's done and I can kick back with quart of tequila and
celebrate all the hard work I've put into this. Hope somebody appreciates it. Later.

I had to upload a new update for the 8kun Bread Launcher because I found some issues with Chrome-based browsers.
The problem is that Chrome is a dog at opening new tabs and preparing the DOM. It reports that it is ready
when it is not. This forces me to place extra checks and timeouts to make sure that the DOM is actually ready to be
modified correctly. If I don't do this, I get the wrong values for things like the width or height of an element.
This causes two problems when opening a new tab: the title in the status bar may not appear and images may be
placed on the wrong side (the right instead of the left).
<p>
Another thing is that Chrome is stubborn about timers running in a page. It wants to slow them down when the page
is in the background. That's fine. I understand how some web developers will abuse timers. However, a timer
should only be slowed down if it consumes a lot of CPU. The auto-update timer in the Launcher does not consume CPU
until it hits zero. There is no good reason to slow it down but Chrome is dumb and stupid about it. Anyway, the
solution is to move the timer out of the main page and into the daughter page (because the main page is running
in the background). It's just one line of code. Chrome will only slow it down if the daughter page goes to the
background. Which is still wrong but it is at least tolerable.

I am pleased to announce that the 8kun Bread Launcher finally supports posting. This is just a preliminary update.
The posting feature is not yet full-featured but that'll come in the next week or so. Barring head-scratching
complications, of course, and I've had a lot of them with this update. HTML and CSS never cease to present me
with browser compatibility problems. For example, it turns out that Chrome browsers put a little blank space below
the &lt;textarea&gt; element that should not be there. I had to hit the Internet to find a solution which was to
add the setting "vertical-align:top" to the CSS for the element. Really??? Why do these things happen? Oh well. At
least we are past the bad old days of Internet Explorer and Netscape.
<p>
Something is totally buggered with the "XMLHttpRequest" component. This is used to implement the posting operation.
I could have used "fetch", which is what I would normally do, but I wanted to implement an upload progress indicator
and that is not possible with "fetch". I got the indicator working but it doesn't actually work. I know it doesn't
work in Firefox and I haven't bothered to test with the other browsers but my research on the net seems to indicate
that this is a problem all around. The problem is with the "onprogress" callback which doesn't fire at
regular intervals and often indicates the wrong amount of progress. I mean, it'll jump to 62% done right off the bat
and then not fire again. Shit like that. Oh well, at least the uploading works.

<b> On this day of September 17, 2021</b>
<p>
I encountered a peculiar artifact while I was revamping the HTML for the Alleycat main page. My goal was to keep
the text in a panel separate from the image in the same panel such that, if you zoom in (or if the user forces a
larger font), the text won't wrap around the image as the panel expands vertically. Also, the image will remain
centered. The only practical way to achieve such is to use a table format. An odd thing happened due to the inclusion
of a table inside the panel. A 5-pixel-tall space appeared below the bottom border of each panel.
<p>
It was not my CSS that caused this spatial displacement. There was absolutely no reason for it and the artifact
appeared in different browsers. In Firefox, the spacing varied by a pixel (arrgh). Originally, the panels were
constructed with a &lt;div&gt; tag so I simply built the table inside the div. Removing the div and transferring
the CSS to the &lt;table&gt; tag cleared up the problem. I have no idea what went wrong but I guess I should be
happy that it is now fixed.
<p>
I have a similar issue with Alleycat Player and it may be due to the way the table format conflicts with something
else in the video viewers. All three viewers should be displayed exactly the same but they are not. There is
one out of the three which has a slight difference somewhere. This varies with different browsers. It's been months
and I still can't figure it out. Grrrrr.
<p>
<b>Addendum:</b> After writing the above, I discovered something else. The problem was caused by declaring
"display:inline-block" in the CSS for the div. The artifact goes away with "display:block". Alternatively,
the declaration "vertical-align:middle" also works. Why???

The <g_>8kun Bread Launcher</g_> has been updated in response to a recent change to the media server on 8kun. The media
server went down at 3PM on August 26 and was restored on September 13 after a downtime of 18 days and 4.5 hours. The
new domain for the media server is "images.128ducks.com". This condition is only temporary. Who knows how temporary?
