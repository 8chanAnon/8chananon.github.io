<b> On this day of September 17, 2021</b>
<p>
I encountered a peculiar artifact while I was revamping the HTML for the Alleycat main page. My goal was to keep
the text in a panel separate from the image in the same panel such that, if you zoom in (or if the user forces a
larger font), the text won't wrap around the image as the panel expands vertically. Also, the image will remain
centered. The only practical way to achieve such is to use a table format. An odd thing happened due to the inclusion
of a table inside the panel. A 5-pixel-tall space appeared below the bottom border of each panel.
<p>
It was not my CSS that caused this spatial displacement. There was absolutely no reason for it and the artifact
appeared in different browsers. In Firefox, the spacing varied by a pixel (arrgh). Originally, the panels were
constructed with a &lt;div&gt; tag so I simply built the table inside the div. Removing the div and transferring
the CSS to the &lt;table&gt; tag cleared up the problem. I have no idea what went wrong but I guess I should be
happy that it is now fixed.
<p>
I have a similar issue with Alleycat Player and it may be due to the way the table format conflicts with something
else in the video viewers. All three viewers should be displayed exactly the same but they are not. There is
one out of the three which has a slight difference somewhere. This varies with different browsers. It's been months
and I still can't figure it out. Grrrrr.
<p>
<b>Addendum:</b> After writing the above, I discovered something else. The problem was caused by declaring
"display:inline-block" in the CSS for the div. The artifact goes away with "display:block". Alternatively,
the declaration "vertical-align:middle" also works. Why???

<b>News item for September 15, 2021</b>
<p>
The <g_>8kun Bread Launcher</g_> has been updated in response to a recent change to the media server on 8kun. The media
server went down at 3PM on August 26 and was restored on September 13 after a downtime of 18 days and 4.5 hours. The
new domain for the media server is "images.128ducks.com". This condition is only temporary. Who knows how temporary?
